### Note 12 May 2016
- Baseline compiler options: 
  * `-mcpu=cortex-a8` : select CPU. We use ARM Cortex A8
  * `-ftree-vectorize`: automatic vectorization. See: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization)
  * `-O3`: optimization level 3
  * `-mfpu=vfp`: specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is available on the target. Select `vfp` for baseline. See: [Cortex-A8](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Cortex-A8)
  * `-mfloat-abi=softfp`: specifies which floating-point ABI to use. For this case use `softfp` to use hardware floating point but still uses soft-float calling convention. See: [GCC ARM](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html)
- Collect execution time data for each modification of compiler options (with/without FPU) and for each of the available pictures (3 pictures). We decided to take at least 10 samples per configurations. Thus, in total there are 60 samples collected.
